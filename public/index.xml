      <description>After my first semester exams in college (Computer Science Engineering, of course!) was over, we got the results.
Fortunately, I got good marks. I eagerly wanted to know what my rank was.
But, I didnâ€™t want to ask each and every person to about their score. We studied Python in our first semester (But I knew python before it) .
So, I thought like to make a python script to scrape all the grades and CGPA of my classmates.</description>

      <title>Creating Command Line Torrent Searcher</title>

      <description>Its been difficult to search torrents in the web these days. So, I planned to create a torrent searching script using python. First of all, we need asource to scrap the torrents.
I use the following torrent websites:
 The Pirate Bay snowfl Skytorrents  Review The Pirate Bay proxies are banned pretty quickly. So, its waste to use them.
Snowfl is great since that website itself scraps torrents from tpb and 1337x etc&amp;hellip; But there is no way to provide search arguments in the url.</description>

      <description>Hello people, For the past month, I have been thinking about starting a blog. I wanted to have full customization. So, I didn&amp;rsquo;t chose wordpress or blogger or any other corporate website creator. Remaining option is Static Site Generator. I searched for the best SSG. I seen Jekyll. But, Hugo seems to have more customization like JSON output,RSS feed etc. Which are needed because I planned to create an app for this blog.</description>
