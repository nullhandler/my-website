Hello people,
	For the past month, I have been thinking about starting a blog.
I wanted to have full customization. So, I didn't chose wordpress or blogger or any other corporate website creator.
Remaining option is Static Site Generator. I searched for the best SSG.
I seen <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. But, 
<a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a> seems to have more customization like JSON output,RSS feed etc.
Which are needed because I planned to create an app for this blog.
So, lets start this wonderful Journey.
And thanks <a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank">Gitlab</a> for providing hosting free for this blog.
